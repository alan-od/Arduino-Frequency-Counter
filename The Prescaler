<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The MC12080
Prescaler</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">I eventually managed
to get the Prescaler working but it was hard work!  I purchased a
number of MC12080 chips from a Chinese supplier, they were very
cheap, about $1 each with the thought that members of the radio club
could upgrade their frequency counters at a later date. I soldered
the chip into my prototype board and tested the counter.  The chip
divided the input frequency, but it divided the frequency by 2 not
10.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">After some time I
ordered a few MC12080's from a Hong Kong supplier.  This time the
chips had different markings so I thought they would be okay.  After
soldering the chip onto the board, under test it exhibited exactly
the same response as had the first chip i.e. it divided by 2 not 10. 
Again the chips were just over $1 dollar each.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Eventually I
purchased a MC12080 from a UK supplier. This time the chip cost Â£4.50
(~$5).  I soldered the chip onto the board and this time it divided
the input frequency by 10 and up to 1GHz. It may work at an even
higher frequencies but my signal generator doesn't go beyond 1GHz.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">So in conclusion it
looks as if the far eastern market is awash with fake and reject
MC12080s. Also the suppliers of these chips probably don't even know
their selling sub-standard goods.  Buyer beware!</p>
